<!-- This file is the *AD* for a JGL experiment -->

<!-- This file should be stand-alone. All javascript, CSS, and html
should be contained within this single file. This helps ensure that 
the ad can be hosted on any HTTPS server, and still function correctly.
This is not a best practice, but fuck that shit. -->

<!-- This file relies on: mmturkey, which it uses to submit to mturk -->

<!-- 
	The ad.html has a very specific format.

	Really there are two "ads" contained within this file.

	The first ad displays to participants who are browsing
	the Amazon Mechanical Turk site but have not yet accepted
	your hit.  

	The second part of the ad display after the person selected
	"Accept HIT" on the Amazon website.  This will reload the
	ad and will display a button which, when clicked, will pop
	open a new browser window pointed at your local psiTurk
	server (assuming it is running and accessible to the Internet).

	See comments throughout for hints
