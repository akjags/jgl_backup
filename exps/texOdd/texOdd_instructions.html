<div id="instruct-1">
  <p> Before we begin, please expand this window to full screen and refresh the page! </p>
  <p> Your task is to identify the image which looks the most different from the others. On each trial you will be presented with three images, as shown below. </p>
  <img src="exps/texOdd/example2.png" style="width:25%" text-align="center">
  <p>Your job is to press a key (either y, g or j) to indicate whether the top image (y), the left image (g), or the right image (j) is most different. In this example, the odd-one-out is the right image, so you would click the "j" key to respond.</p>
</div>

<div id="instruct-2">
  <p>Pretty simple, right? Well there are two things that are going to make this tricky: </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 40px"> (1) You have to identify the odd one out without looking directly at any of the images. In this study, we're interested in peripheral vision, so we ask that you keep your eyes focused on that white + in the middle of the screen and use your periphery to make the judgment. </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 40px">(2) The images will only be presented for 2 seconds and you have to make your decision before they disappear! So this will require that you not look around too much and that you act quickly and decisively. </p>
  <img src="exps/texOdd/example1.png" style="width:25%" text-align="center">
  <p> (In this example, the odd-one-out is the left image, so you would have clicked the "g" key to respond.) </p>
 
</div>

<div id="instruct-3">
	<p>You'll have just 2 seconds to respond (by pressing either Y G or J), then the images will disappear and you'll receive feedback, telling you whether you were correct or incorrect. You should try to always answer even if you're not sure. It's bettter to guess wrong than to not respond at all, so please try to respond quickly on each trial, so that your response gets registered! </p>
</div>

<div id="instruct-4">
	<p>Please pay attention and do your best.</p>
	<p><b>Warning:</b> there are a few attention check trials interspersed throughout the experiment.</p>
</div>

<div id="instruct-5">
  <p>We'll start with 5 quick trials to practice, and after that, we will get into the real trials, where you must complete 5 blocks of 20 trials each.</p>
  <p>Just to remind you one last time: you'll see 3 images and respond with Y G or J to indicate which of the 3 images presented (up, left or right) looks most different from the others.</p>
  <img src="exps/texOdd/example3.png" style="width:25%" text-align="center">
  <p> So in this final example, the odd-one-out is the right image, so you would click "j" to respond. </p>
  <p> Click next to try 5 trials on your own as practice! </p>
</div>

<div id="instruct-block1">
	 <p>Are you getting the hang of it? Now we'll start with the real experiment! If you complete the task with minimal breaks, it should take about 10 minutes total.</p>
   <p> Note: if you did not receive any feedback ("correct" or "incorrect") after responding, that means you are not clicking the correct keys. Make sure you are pressing either the "y" "g" or "j" keys before the images disappear from the screen.</p>
   <p>Click next to begin your first block of 20 trials (5 blocks total). </p>
</div>

<div id="instruct-block2">
	 <p>You are doing great: one block down, 4 to go! Approximately 8 minutes remaining.</p>
   <p>Feel free to take a break if needed, then click next to begin your second block of 20 trials (5 blocks total). </p>
</div>


<div id="instruct-block3">
	 <p>Almost halfway done! Approximately 6 minutes remaining.</p>
   <p>Feel free to take a break if needed, then click next to begin your third block of 20 trials (5 blocks total). </p>
</div>

<div id="instruct-block4">
	 <p>Great work - approximately 4 minutes remaining.</p>
   <p>Feel free to take a break if needed, then click next to begin your fourth block of 20 trials (5 blocks total). </p>
</div>

<div id="instruct-block5">
	 <p>Almost done - just one block left! Approximately 2 minutes remaining.</p>
   <p>Click next to begin your final block of 20 trials (5 blocks total). </p>
</div>
